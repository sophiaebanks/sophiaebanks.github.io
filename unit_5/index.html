	<p class="article"><b>In Other, Other Words</b> is a space online where creative women of color can come and shed the labels that they carry around with them all day. A place where they can find wells of inspiration and information about life and success that encourages them to go back out into the world and let it know exactly who they are and who they intend to be. In Other, Other Words encourages the wholehearted exploration of self. </p>
	
	<p class="article">It takes constant effort to do this, but here – where we can connect to one another’s words and stories – it’s something to be celebrated. Let’s add to this other, other world that we’re creating. </p>
