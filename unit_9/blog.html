	<p>It was when I was 17 years old that I began to doubt everything I was raised to believe – about God, about the Church, about faith, and about life. Catholicism has been in my family for about four generations, you see, and when you are born into a devout Catholic home, you have no say in your participation. You are born, you get baptised, and every Sunday, you are put in the car and taken to church. You participate in the rituals, and you ponder the contents of the homily, however superficially. You get back in the car to be taken home, and you go about your week until next Sunday.</p>

	<p>As a Catholic, chances are you will attend a Catholic school. The purpose of the Catholic school is to reinforce the values that have been instilled in you at home and at church. For people like me, there is a high chance that you never really thought about the tenets of the faith because you never truly had to learn the faith. What I mean is, though you may have studied the watered down Catechism of the Catholic Church in preparation for First Holy Communion, you probably never had to study the faith in detail in order to “choose” Catholicism. Catholicism is essentially thrust upon you, and you have to deal with it.</p>

	<p>At 17, I began studying Beliefs in Society as part of my Sociology A-Level course. I discovered the various “beliefs” in the world, and I began to question what I had grown up thinking was the single right way to view the world, both knowable and unknowable. I began to engage with material from various cultures and traditions, and I felt the reality I had become familiar with, crumble. One thing sounded wrong, and everything else followed. In a quest for answers to the questions that burned, I turned to the non-theists of our time. I read and enjoyed Hitchens. I felt he gave me the appropriate answers to the questions I asked – to me, he said, “All of this is bullshit. Leave it alone and pursue something worth pursuing. Philosophy, perhaps?”</p>

	<p>In fact, I became so insufferable that my father came home one day and said, “Go and report yourself to the priest!” I was very active on Twitter during that time in my life, and I used Twitter as a means of communicating with people who shared my interests. I would post excerpts from books I was reading and make outrageous claims about the problems and failures of the bible and of religion as an institution. I was what one might call a “militant atheist.” I do refer to that phase as my militant atheist phase.</p>

	<p>After my father told me to report myself to the priest at our parish, I booked a meeting with him and felt terrified by the entire ordeal. I thought: What would he think of me? I am active in the Church! O, what have I done?</p>

	<p>But I was in for a big surprise. Having grown up in Nigeria, where Catholicism, as Chimamanda Adichie eloquently put it, is practised as a culture of duty, as something you do not question but simply obey, I thought Catholicism was like that everywhere. I walked into the priests’ house with some trepidation. I went through my troubles step by step, questioning everything I was raised to believe. The priest looked at me, ever so calmly – he remains my favourite priest to this day – and said, “I understand where your father is coming from; but, I also know that it is normal, natural even, for young people to have these questions.” We talked for an hour or two, after which he gave me some material to read and explore to help with my questions. He also told me to look into people who questioned and struggled, and came out stronger in their faith, as well as those who came out without any semblance of faith.</p>

	<p>Three or so months ago, I met a group of young Nigerians through a friend. We talked about everything, from books, to America’s history of violence (inspired by Ta-Nehisi Coates’ book), to parent-child relationships, especially in Nigerian homes. We also talked about God, and I shared the story of my struggle with the idea of God. I was terrified, I felt as though I had revealed a horrible part of me that would make them not want to talk to me anymore. I looked down at some point during the conversation, after lowering my voice, and I said, “I feel like a terrible person. I feel like you’re all watching me.”</p>

	<p>They said, “No. It’s ok. It’s very hard, but you have to be open to a relationship with God. It takes time, and it’s very hard, but make the first step.” One of them said the first step was willingness, and I had already made it. Another one said, “Talk to God, too.” She shared her experience of how she began ‘praying’ or talking to God. It was funny, but it moved me. She said it was something as simple as going to the shop and saying something like, “Okay, hi God. I’m here. Let me know what you want me to have.” At the end of our discussion, we prayed as a group. We went around the table, and we each had to say something. I was terrified because I have always felt like I do not know ‘how’ to pray in the ‘right’ way. They reassured me that there is no single ‘right’ way. Rather, one simply talks to God. I said my prayer last, and my friends made me feel warm, which I appreciated, especially as there were about three awkward pauses during my prayer. I also said the same thing twice or thrice.</p>

	<p>I returned home that night with a renewed enthusiasm to be close to God, to open myself up to the beauty of loving God. I have started making my journey back to a place of reconciliation — with the Church, with faith, with God. I do not know that I feel totally comfortable with the Church right now, but I have settled my inner quarrels. I no longer want to ‘understand’ the Church, the institution; I want to draw nearer to God. To do this, I cannot rely solely on rationality to understand the nature of God, or the importance of faith. In order to draw nearer to God, I have to let myself be willing, and, most importantly, I have to love.</p>

	<p>As Pope Francis once said in a homily, “Preach the gospel always, and if necessary, use words.”</p>
